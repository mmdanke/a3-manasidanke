Assignment 3 - Persistence: Two-tier Web Application with Flat File Database, Express server, and CSS template
===

Baseline Requirements
---

Your application is required to implement the following functionalities:

- a `Server`, created using Express (no alternatives will be accepted for this assignment)
- a `Results` functionality which shows the entire dataset residing in the server's memory
- a `Form/Entry` functionality which allows users to add, modify, and delete data items (must be all three!) associated with their user name / account.
- Use of at least five [Express middleware packages](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html). 
- Persistent data storage in between server sessions. [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) is a suitable database package for this assignment and will be discussed in class.
- Use of a [CSS framework or template]

Node.js:
- A server using Express, at least five pieces of Express middleware, and a persistent database (a flat file using lowdb is great).

Deliverables

Do the following to complete this assignment:

4. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `a3-yourname` so we can find it.
5. Fork this repository and modify the README to the specifications below. You do not need to include any of your project files in this repo (we will see those on Glitch), you only need to update and commit the README file.
6. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. Name the pull request using the following template: `a3-gitname-firstname-lastname`.


## Your Web Application Title

your glitch link e.g. http://a3-charlieroberts.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy / database you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why.
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored.
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does.

## Technical Achievements

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I tested my application using screen reading software, and found that...
- **Design Achievement 2**: I followed best practices for accessibility, including providing alt attributes for images and using semantic HTML. There are no `<div>` or `<span>` elements in my document.
- **Design Achievement 3**: We tested the application with n=X users, finding that...
