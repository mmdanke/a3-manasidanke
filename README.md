- The goal of the application:
- Challenges you faced in realizing the application:
- What authentication strategy / database you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable):
- What CSS framework you used and why:
  - Modifications to the CSS framework I made via custom CSS I authored.
- The five Express middleware packages I used and a summary of what each one does:

   - Express: a middleware and routing web framework with minimal functionality that listens for requests and calls the appropriate functions.
 - Cookie-parser: "parses cookies attached to the client request object."
 - Passport: authenticates requests through strategies such as the Local strategy(in this example).
 - Helmet: automatically sets various HTTP headers and prevents "sensitive information from unintentially being passed between the server and client."
 - Express.static: serves static files from the path where files are being drawn from by the application
 - Body-parser: parses incoming http request bodies before handlers.
